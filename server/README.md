# Server Folder - OPTIONAL

## ⚠️ This folder is NOT needed for your portfolio!

Your portfolio now uses **EmailJS** for the contact form, which works directly from the browser without needing a backend server.

## What This Means

- ✅ No server deployment needed
- ✅ No server costs
- ✅ Works on all devices (mobile, desktop, tablet)
- ✅ Simpler to maintain
- ✅ 200 free emails per month with EmailJS

## Can I Delete This Folder?

**Yes!** You can safely delete the entire `server` folder. It's kept here only as a reference in case you want to implement your own backend in the future.

## Current Setup

Your contact form uses:
- **EmailJS** - Direct email sending from browser
- **Service ID**: service_9rcy6cl
- **Template ID**: template_1p0hi6e
- **Public Key**: yH1wQOIUVkp1EXUUb

## If You Want to Use This Backend Instead

If you prefer to use this Node.js backend:

1. Deploy this folder to Render/Railway
2. Update Contact.jsx to use your backend URL
3. Add environment variables on your hosting platform

But **EmailJS is recommended** for portfolio sites!

**Your portfolio works perfectly without this folder!** 🎉
